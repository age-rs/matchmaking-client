# WololoKingdoms

A GUI-less Rust implementation of [WololoKingdoms](https://github.com/Jineapple/WololoKingdoms). WololoKingdoms is made by Tails8521, Jineapple, TriRem and others.

This is a straight port of their code, without Boost and Qt dependencies, and in Rust instead of C++.

C++ WololoKingdoms is available under the GPL v3, just like this project.
